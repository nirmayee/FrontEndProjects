# Webdesign_Ass_2
For my personal portfolio:
I have prepared an external CSS file to style the html pages.
I have added a nav bar (nav tag) where I have added an unordered list (ul tag) displaying in horizontal through CSS. I have connected every <li> tag with a new html file that should be displayed.
Next, I have used multiple <div> and <p>  tags that allow me to display and style my name (h1 tag), my position (h2 tag) and added a background image via css. For the two buttons I have used <button> tags.
 I have embedded a resume link (<a href> tag) in my button tag which allows me to download my resume. This is one of my unique features My second unique feature is that I have imported an font and added it to my external css file. Third, being I have embedded google maps in my contact me page with the use of iframe tag (<iframe>)
For my about me page, I have used a column layout structure with 2 columns at 50% so that my information and photo appear on each side. 
For the project pages I have created an image gallery with multiple div tags and added hover effect on them. I have connected these projects to either the paper that I have published or the git repository. I have also used absolute positions at times in the css to stye it. I have added “float, width, padding, margin, border-radius, box-shadow” properties while styling my gallery.
For the contact me page I have added a form (<form >) as well and later added the embedded google maps to the page
For the footer I have included a “mailto: “feature in my < a href > tag.
The website is fully responsive.
