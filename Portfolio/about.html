    <p style = "color:white"><br> I have always been a curious kid, this inquistiveness helped me kindle an interest in technology. My undergraduate studies were dedicated to understanding core concepts of application development and management. I worked on several projects covering various domains such as 
                  <em >Web Development, Business Analysis and Database Management</em>. 
                  <br> <br>  <br> <br>
                 As a analyst in an engineering consultancy company, I have served my clients by understanding their requirements and formulating solutions with the help of inhouse subject matter experts. While my work has always focused on serving customers at a personal level, my passion has evolved to serving customers with better expertise. It is for this reason that I am pursuing a master in Information Systems. </p>
