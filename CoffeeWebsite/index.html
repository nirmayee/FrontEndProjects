              <h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
              <p> Boston Coffee  is an American chain store of bakery-café fast casual restaurants with over 2,000 locations, all of which are in the United States and Canada. Its headquarters are in Sunset Hills, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. The company operates as Saint Louis Bread Company in the Greater St. Louis area, where it has over 100 locations. Offerings include bakery items, pasta, salads, sandwiches, soups, and specialty drinks. As of 2020, the menu also includes flatbread pizzas. <br> <br>

                The company, which also owns Au Bon Pain, is owned by JAB Holding Company which is, in turn, owned by the Reimann family of Germany. <br> <br>
                
                Panera offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as bagels, brownies, cookies, croissants, muffins, and scones. These, along with Panera's artisan breads, are typically baked before dawn by an on-staff baker. Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout including: flatbreads, panini, Panera Kids, pastas, salads, sandwiches, side choices, and soups, as well as coffee, espresso drinks, frozen drinks, fruit smoothies, hot chocolate, iced drinks, lattes, lemonade, and tea. <br><br>

                Panera Bread. Even though Panera Bread bills itself as a healthy alternative to most fast-food chains, many of its sandwiches are no healthier—or they're worse—than what you'd find at a McDonald's. The "Sierra Turkey" on Asiago cheese focaccia has 920 calories, 49 grams of fat, and 1,900 mg of salt. Even the vegetarian option, tomato and mozzarella on ciabatta bread, has 770 calories, 29 grams of fat, and 1,290 mg of salt. To put this in perspective, a McDonald's double cheeseburger has 440 calories, 23 grams of fat, and 1,150 mg. of salt. If you're opting for a salad, also beware—while their calorie counts are relatively low, the amount of salt, even before dressing, can come close to 1,000 mg.<br><br>
